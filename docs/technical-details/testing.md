# Testing Guide 

**Form Validations:** Form validations are checks that are performed on user input data to ensure that the data meets certain criteria before it is submitted. This is typically done on forms that are filled out on websites or applications, such as a registration form or a checkout form. The purpose of form validations is to prevent errors and improve the user experience by providing feedback to the user when input data is incorrect or incomplete.

When a form validation is marked as "Passed," it means that the data entered by the user has passed all of the checks and is considered valid. This means that the data can be safely submitted and processed by the website or application.

**Hooks:** Hooks tests will be done soon.
